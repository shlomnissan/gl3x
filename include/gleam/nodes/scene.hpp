/**
 * @brief Root node and entry point for a scene graph.
 *
 * `Scene` is the top-level container for all nodes in a Gleam application. It acts as the
 * root of the scene graph and is responsible for propagating update and input events
 * throughout the hierarchy. Each application has one active scene at a time, which is
 * managed by the `Application`.
 *
 * A custom scene can be created by inheriting from this class and overriding behavior
 * or adding initial nodes. The scene must be provided to the application during startup:
 *
 * @code
 * class MyApp : public gleam::Application {
 * public:
 *   auto Configure() -> void override {
 *     params.title = "My App";
 *   }
 *
 *   auto CreateScene() -> std::shared_ptr<gleam::Scene> override {
 *     auto scene = gleam::Scene::Create();
 *     // Add nodes to the scene
 *     return scene;
 *   }
 *
 *   auto Update(float delta) -> bool override {
 *     // Called every frame
 *     return true;
 *   }
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Only one scene can be attached to the application context at a time.
 * Attaching a new scene using gleam::Application::SetScene replaces the current one.
