 * @brief Represents a mouse input event.
 *
 * A mouse event is dispatched when the cursor moves, a button is pressed or
 * released, or the scroll wheel is used. It extends the base @ref Event with
 * data specific to mouse input: the @ref MouseEvent::Type "interaction type",
 * the @ref MouseEvent::position "cursor position", and optional
 * @ref MouseEvent::button "button information".
 *
 * Events are dispatched through the @ref Scene hierarchy where nodes can
 * override the @ref Node::OnMouseEvent handler and optionally mark the event
 * as @ref Event::handled "handled". When handled is set to `true`, the event
 * stops propagating to other nodes.
 *
 * @code
 * class MyNode : public vglx::Node {
 * public:
 *   auto OnMouseEvent(vglx::MouseEvent* event) -> void override {
 *     if (event->type == vglx::MouseEvent::Type::ButtonPressed) {
 *       if (event->button == vglx::MouseButton::Left) {

 *         event->handled = true; // stop propagation
