 * @brief Provides access to shared runtime parameters and services.
 *
 * The shared context encapsulates common runtime state and services accessible
 * throughout the scene graph. It is constructed and propagated automatically
 * by the runtime, which also keeps its values synchronized as rendering
 * parameters change — such as window size, framebuffer dimensions, or the
 * active camera.
 *
 * Nodes can access the shared context via the @ref Node::OnAttached
 * callback, which is invoked when the node joins an active scene hierarchy.
 * Override this method in your node subclass to perform initialization
 * that depends on the context — such as loading resources, querying the
 * active camera, or accessing other global services.
 *
