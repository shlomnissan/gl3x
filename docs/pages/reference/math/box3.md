# Box3


Axis-aligned bounding box defined by minimum and maximum corners.
`Box3` represents a 3D volume bounded by two corners: `min` and `max`. It is used for spatial queries, frustum culling, and bounding volume computations. All operations assume the box is axis-aligned and defined in local space.
