# Spherical


Spherical coordinates (radius, phi, theta).
Represents a point in 3D using spherical coordinates:`radius` is the distance from the origin.`phi` is the azimuth angle (yaw) in radians.`theta` is the polar angle (pitch) from the equator in radians.

`radius` is the distance from the origin.

`phi` is the azimuth angle (yaw) in radians.

`theta` is the polar angle (pitch) from the equator in radians.

This is useful for orbital camera rigs, sampling directions on a sphere, and converting to/from Cartesian coordinates.
