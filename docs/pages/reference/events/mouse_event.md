# MouseEvent


Event representing mouse movement, clicks, or scroll input.
`MouseEvent` is dispatched when the mouse moves, a button is pressed or released, or the scroll wheel is used. Nodes can handle this event by overriding the `OnMouseEvent()` method. The event contains mouse position, scroll delta, button state, and event type.

```cpp
class MyNode : public gleam::Node {
public:
  auto OnMouseEvent(gleam::MouseEvent* event) -> void override {
    if (
      event->type == gleam::MouseEvent::Type::ButtonPressed &&
      event->button == gleam::MouseButton::Left
    ) {
      Select();
    }

    if (event->type == gleam::MouseEvent::Type::Moved) {
      UpdateCursor(event->position);
    }
  }
};
```
## Properties

- `MouseButton button`
  - Mouse button involved in the event (if any).

- `Vector2 position`
  - Current cursor position in window coordinates.

- `Vector2 scroll`
  - Scroll delta since last event.

- `MouseEvent::Type type`
  - Mouse event type.
