# SceneEvent


Event representing a change in the scene graph hierarchy.
`SceneEvent` is dispatched when a node is added to or removed from the active scene. It contains a reference to the affected node and the type of change.

This event type is currently used internally by the active scene object to track hierarchy changes and **cannot be handled by individual nodes**.
