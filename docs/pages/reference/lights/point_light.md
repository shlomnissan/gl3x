# PointLight


Represents a light that gets emitted from a single point in all directions.
A common use case for this is to replicate the light emitted from a bare lightbulb.

```cpp
auto point_light = gleam::PointLight::Create({
  .color = 0xFFFFFF,
  .intensity = 1.0f,
  .attenuation = {
    .base = 1.0f,
    .linear = 0.0f,
    .quadratic = 0.0f
  }
});
```
## Properties

- `Attenuation attenuation`
  - Light attenuation properties.
