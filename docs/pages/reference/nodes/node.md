# Node


Base class for all scene graph objects.
`Node` represents a transformable object that can be placed within a scene graph hierarchy. Nodes support local and world transforms, parent-child relationships, and can respond to events and updates. All renderable, light-emitting, and camera entities in the engine inherit from this class.

Nodes can be organized in a tree structure, and transformations will propagate through the hierarchy. When attached to a scene, nodes gain access to the shared context and may perform initialization in `OnAttached(SharedContextPointer context)`.

To define behavior, override virtual methods such as `OnUpdate()`, `OnKeyboardEvent()`, or `OnMouseEvent()`.
